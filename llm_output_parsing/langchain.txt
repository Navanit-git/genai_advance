Langchain has 3 major product I can see
Langchain LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).
LangGraph LangGraph is built for developers who want to build powerful, adaptable AI agents
LangSmith LangSmith is a platform for building production-grade LLM applications. It allows you to closely monitor and evaluate your application, so you can ship quickly and with confidence.



LangChain Expression Language(LCEL)
LCEL is an orchestration solution -- it allows LangChain to handle run-time execution of chains in an optimized way.
While we have seen users run chains with hundreds of steps in production, we generally recommend using LCEL for simpler orchestration tasks. 
Here are some guidelines:

If you are making a single LLM call, you don't need LCEL; instead call the underlying chat model directly.
If you have a simple chain (e.g., prompt + llm + parser, simple retrieval set up etc.), LCEL is a reasonable fit, if you're taking advantage of the LCEL benefits.
If you're building a complex chain (e.g., with branching, cycles, multiple agents, etc.) use LangGraph instead. Remember that you can always use LCEL within individual nodes in LangGraph.

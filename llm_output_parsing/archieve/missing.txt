Things to add (important, currently missing)
Validation & repair loop
Automated validator (Pydantic/JSON Schema) → on failure, do an auto-repair prompt (e.g., fix_json) → retry or escalate. Show examples and metrics for schema compliance.

Testing & Metrics
Unit tests for tools/functions, synthetic test cases for structured output, schema-compliance rate, precision/recall for extraction tasks, latency and cost per call.

Monitoring & observability
Logging (requests/responses), schema failure rates, tool call success/failure, latency tracking, alerting.

Security, privacy & access control
Sanitization of PII before sending to LLMs, least-privilege for tools/APIs, rate-limiting, API key management, and audit logs.

Robustness / adversarial input
Adversarial tests, prompt delimiters, input sanitization, guardrails (role prompts, validators), and fallbacks to human review for edge cases.

Cost & performance considerations
Sampling tradeoffs (temperature, n), batching, parallel tool calls, caching results for repeated queries.

Human-in-the-loop flow
Escalation rules when model confidence is low or schema validation fails.

Evaluation datasets & benchmarks
Create small labeled datasets (resumes → JSON, invoices → fields) to measure extraction accuracy over time.

Examples & exercises
Concrete hands-on exercises (build a toy agent that: parses an invoice → updates DB → emails receipt), plus sample notebooks.

# Comprehensive Guide to Combining Reasoning, Structured Output, and Tool/Function Calling in LLMs

## Introduction
As of August 7, 2025, combining reasoning, structured output, and tool/function calling in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a cornerstone of building advanced AI systems for industrial applications. This approach enables LLMs to reason through complex problems, interact with external tools or APIs, and deliver machine-readable outputs in formats like JSON, XML, or CSV. Such capabilities are essential for applications like logistics planning, customer support automation, and data analysis, where precision, automation, and integration with external systems are critical. This guide provides a modular framework for mastering this combined method, covering foundational concepts, implementation strategies for both large and small models, advanced techniques, and real-world applications. It emphasizes practical exercises and robust error handling to ensure production-ready solutions.

## Module 1: Understanding the Combined Approach

### Concepts
- **Reasoning**:
  - Involves logical deduction, planning, or multi-step analysis to solve complex problems.
  - Techniques include Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, self-consistency reasoning, and Tree of Thoughts (ToT).
  - Example: Breaking down a query like “Plan a trip to Paris” into steps like finding flights, booking hotels, and checking weather.
- **Structured Output**:
  - Formats LLM responses into predefined structures (e.g., JSON, XML, CSV) for easy integration with databases or APIs.
  - Ensures consistency and machine-readability, critical for automation workflows.
  - Example: Returning a JSON object with flight details, hotel bookings, and weather forecasts.
- **Tool/Function Calling**:
  - Enables LLMs to interact with external tools or APIs, such as fetching real-time data or performing calculations.
  - Tools can include APIs (e.g., weather, calendar), databases, or custom functions (e.g., calculators).
  - Example: Calling a weather API to retrieve forecast data for a specific city.
- **Combined Approach**:
  - The LLM reasons through a query to determine necessary steps, selects appropriate tools, and formats the results in a structured output.
  - Example Workflow: For “Plan a trip to Paris,” the LLM reasons through steps, calls a flight API, hotel API, and weather API, and returns a JSON object with all details.

### Importance
This combined method is pivotal for industrial applications because:
- **Reasoning** ensures accurate problem-solving and decision-making.
- **Tool Calling** extends LLM capabilities to interact with real-world systems.
- **Structured Output** enables seamless integration with software systems, reducing manual processing.

### Practice
1. **Setup**: Install required libraries: `pip install langchain openai pydantic guardrails-ai`.
2. **Basic Integration**: Create a simple system with one tool (e.g., weather API), use CoT prompting to reason, and format the output as JSON.
3. **Test Case**: Query the LLM with “What’s the temperature in London plus 100?” and verify the reasoning, tool call, and structured output.

### Example: Basic Combined Approach with LangChain
```python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.output_parsers import StructuredOutputParser, ResponseSchema

# Define tools
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get weather for a city."""
    return f"Weather in {city}: Sunny, 25°C"

def calculate(expression: str) -> float:
    """Perform a calculation."""
    return eval(expression)  # Use cautiously in production

tools = [
    Tool(name="get_weather", func=get_weather, description="Get weather for a city"),
    Tool(name="calculate", func=calculate, description="Perform a calculation")
]

# Define structured output schema
response_schemas = [
    ResponseSchema(name="final_answer", description="The final result", type="float"),
    ResponseSchema(name="reasoning", description="Step-by-step reasoning", type="string")
]
output_parser = StructuredOutputParser.from_response_schemas(response_schemas)

# Initialize agent
llm = OpenAI()
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent="zero-shot-react-description", verbose=True)

# Run query with structured output
result = agent.run("What's the temperature in London plus 100? Format the response as JSON with reasoning.")
print(result)  # Output: {"final_answer": 125.0, "reasoning": "Fetched weather for London: 25°C. Added 100 to get 125."}
```

### Industry Application
- **Logistics Assistant**: Plan delivery routes by reasoning through constraints, calling route optimization APIs, and returning structured JSON with route details.

## Module 2: Implementation with Large Models

### Concepts
- **Large Models**: Models like GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and OpenAI’s o3-mini have native support for tool calling and structured outputs, making them ideal for complex reasoning tasks.
- **Integration Workflow**:
  - **Reasoning**: Use CoT prompting to break down queries into steps.
  - **Tool Calling**: Define tools using schemas (e.g., OpenAI’s `tools` parameter) and let the LLM select them.
  - **Structured Output**: Use JSON mode or LangChain’s output parsers to ensure machine-readable responses.
- **Advantages**: Large models offer high accuracy and consistency, reducing the need for extensive error handling.

### Practice
1. **Define Tools**: Create schemas for tools like a weather API, calculator, and calendar API.
2. **Reasoning Prompt**: Use CoT prompting to guide the LLM through multi-step reasoning.
3. **Structured Output**: Enforce JSON output using OpenAI’s `response_format={"type": "json_object"}`.
4. **Test Case**: Query with “Plan a meeting in Paris next week and check the weather” and verify the integrated response.

### Example: Combined Approach with OpenAI
```python
import openai
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Define Pydantic model for structured output
class MeetingPlan(BaseModel):
    meeting_details: dict
    weather_forecast: dict
    reasoning: str

# Define tool schemas
tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "book_meeting",
            "description": "Book a meeting with given details",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "date": {"type": "string", "description": "Meeting date"},
                    "time": {"type": "string", "description": "Meeting time"},
                    "attendees": {"type": "string", "description": "Attendees"}
                },
                "required": ["date", "time", "attendees"]
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "get_weather",
            "description": "Get weather forecast for a city",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "city": {"type": "string", "description": "City name"}
                },
                "required": ["city"]
            }
        }
    }
]

# Call OpenAI API
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Plan a meeting in Paris next week and check the weather. Return as JSON."}],
    tools=tools,
    tool_choice="auto",
    response_format={"type": "json_object"}
)

# Process response
tool_calls = response.choices[0].message.tool_calls
if tool_calls:
    meeting_data = {"date": "2025-08-15", "time": "10:00", "attendees": "Team A"}  # Simulated API response
    weather_data = {"city": "Paris", "forecast": "Sunny, 25°C"}  # Simulated API response
    structured_output = MeetingPlan(
        meeting_details=meeting_data,
        weather_forecast=weather_data,
        reasoning="Reasoned that a meeting requires scheduling and weather check. Called book_meeting and get_weather."
    )
    print(structured_output.model_dump_json())
```

### Industry Application
- **Virtual Assistant**: Schedule meetings and provide weather updates for attendees, returning structured JSON for calendar integration.

## Module 3: Implementation with Small Models

### Concepts
- **Challenges**: Small models (e.g., Mistral-7B, Llama 3.1) lack native tool calling support, requiring structured output methods to simulate this functionality.
- **Approach**: Prompt the LLM to generate JSON specifying tool names and arguments, then parse and execute them.
- **Validation**: Use Pydantic or Guardrails AI to ensure output consistency.
- **Reasoning**: Apply CoT prompting to guide small models through logical steps.

### Practice
1. **Select Model**: Use Mistral-7B-Instruct from Hugging Face.
2. **Prompt Design**: Create a prompt that instructs the LLM to reason and return JSON with tool calls.
3. **Tool Execution**: Parse the JSON and execute the corresponding tools.
4. **Test Case**: Query with “Calculate the cost of a trip to Paris” and verify the reasoning, tool calls, and structured output.

### Example: Combined Approach with Small Model
```python
from langchain.llms import HuggingFacePipeline
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.output_parsers import StructuredOutputParser, ResponseSchema
from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError

# Define Pydantic model
class TripPlan(BaseModel):
    flight_cost: float
    hotel_cost: float
    reasoning: str

# Define response schema
response_schemas = [
    ResponseSchema(name="tool", description="The tool to call", type="string"),
    ResponseSchema(name="arguments", description="Tool arguments", type="object"),
    ResponseSchema(name="reasoning", description="Step-by-step reasoning", type="string")
]
output_parser = StructuredOutputParser.from_response_schemas(response_schemas)

# Define prompt
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template="Reason step by step and return a JSON object with tool calls and reasoning. Query: {query}\n{format_instructions}",
    input_variables=["query"],
    partial_variables={"format_instructions": output_parser.get_format_instructions()}
)

# Load small model
llm = HuggingFacePipeline.from_model_id(model_id="mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", task="text-generation")

# Define tools
def get_flight_cost(destination: str) -> float:
    return 500.0  # Simulated API response

def get_hotel_cost(destination: str) -> float:
    return 300.0  # Simulated API response

# Combine prompt and parser
chain = prompt | llm | output_parser

# Invoke chain
result = chain.invoke({"query": "Calculate the cost of a trip to Paris"})
try:
    if result["tool"] == "get_flight_cost":
        flight_cost = get_flight_cost(result["arguments"]["destination"])
    if result["tool"] == "get_hotel_cost":
        hotel_cost = get_hotel_cost(result["arguments"]["destination"])
    structured_output = TripPlan(
        flight_cost=flight_cost,
        hotel_cost=hotel_cost,
        reasoning=result["reasoning"]
    )
    print(structured_output.model_dump_json())
except ValidationError:
    print("Invalid output, retrying...")
```

def get_hotel_cost(destination: str) -> float:
    return 300.0

def get_activities(city: str) -> str:
    return f"Activities in {city}: Sightseeing, Museums"

tools = [
    Tool(name="get_flight_cost", func=get_flight_cost, description="Get flight cost"),
    Tool(name="get_hotel_cost", func=get_hotel_cost, description="Get hotel cost"),
    Tool(name="get_activities", func=get_activities, description="Get activities")
]

# Define structured output schema
response_schemas = [
    ResponseSchema(name="trip_plan", description="Details of the trip", type="object"),
    ResponseSchema(name="reasoning", description="Step-by-step reasoning", type="string")
]
output_parser = StructuredOutputParser.from_response_schemas(response_schemas)

# Initialize agent
llm = OpenAI()
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent="zero-shot-react-description", verbose=True)

# Run query
result = agent.run("Plan a trip to Paris and London. Return as JSON with reasoning.")
print(result)  # Output: {"trip_plan": {"Paris": {...}, "London": {...}}, "reasoning": "..."}
```

# 10 Intermediate Backend Projects for LLM Output Methods

## Introduction
This document outlines 10 intermediate backend projects designed to enhance your technical skills in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for industrial applications. Each project focuses on creating specific functions or tools, generating structured output responses, and incorporating both reasoning (e.g., decision-making, analysis) and non-reasoning (e.g., direct processing) responses. These projects are inspired by real-world scenarios, such as automating workflows, extracting structured data, and building intelligent systems, making them highly relevant for backend development in industries like e-commerce, finance, and customer support. By completing these projects, you’ll gain hands-on experience with libraries like LangChain, OpenAI API, Pydantic, and Guardrails AI, preparing you for advanced AI-driven backend development as of August 6, 2025.

## Objectives
- Develop practical backend systems that leverage LLMs for structured outputs, tool calling, and reasoning.
- Master the creation of functions/tools that integrate with external APIs or databases.
- Implement structured output formats (e.g., JSON) for seamless system integration.
- Understand the difference between reasoning and non-reasoning responses in LLM applications.
- Build projects that mirror real-world industrial use cases, enhancing employability and technical expertise.

## Prerequisites
- Proficiency in Python and familiarity with REST APIs.
- Basic understanding of LLMs and their applications.
- Access to API keys for LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).
- A development environment with Python and libraries: `pip install langchain openai pydantic guardrails-ai instructor`.

## Project Details

### Project 1: API Gateway with Validation
- **Description**: Build an API gateway that validates incoming requests, processes them using an LLM for reasoning tasks (e.g., decision-making), and forwards them to backend services. This mirrors real-world API gateways used in microservices architectures.
- **Functions/Tools**:
  - `validate_request(schema, request)`: Validates the request against a Pydantic schema.
  - `process_request(request)`: Uses an LLM to analyze and process the request (e.g., selecting the best service).
  - `call_backend_service(service, data)`: Calls the appropriate backend service with processed data.
- **Structured Outputs**:
  - Validation: `{ "valid": true, "errors": [] }`
  - Processing: `{ "result": processed_data, "reasoning": "Selected service X because..." }`
  - Backend Call: `{ "status": "success", "data": service_response }`
- **Reasoning**: The LLM decides which backend service to call based on request content (e.g., choosing a payment processor).
- **Non-Reasoning**: Simple validation and direct service calls without LLM involvement.
- **Real-World Scenario**: A payment processing gateway that validates transaction requests and routes them to the appropriate payment provider based on cost or availability.

## Implementation Guidelines
- **Libraries**: Use LangChain for agent orchestration and structured outputs, OpenAI API for function calling, Pydantic for schema validation, and Guardrails AI for enforcing constraints.
- **Error Handling**: Implement retry logic for LLM output failures and API call errors.
- **Testing**: Test with real-world data (e.g., mock APIs, sample datasets) to ensure robustness.
- **Scalability**: Optimize API calls to reduce latency, especially for tool-calling workflows.

## Challenges and Considerations
- **Consistency**: LLMs may not always produce consistent structured outputs; use libraries like Guardrails AI to enforce schemas.
- **Latency**: Tool calling can introduce delays; optimize by caching frequent API responses.
- **Security**: Sanitize LLM inputs and outputs to prevent injection attacks or data leaks.
- **Cost**: Monitor API usage to manage costs, especially with frequent LLM calls.

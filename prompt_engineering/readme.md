# 🧠 Prompting & Inference Mastery Tracker (GenAI Deep-Dive)

A step-by-step roadmap to mastering prompt engineering, structured reasoning, LLM inference, and optimization.

---

## ✅ Study Plan & Checklist

### 📚 1. Survey & Landscape Mapping
- Read **Prompt Report 2024** (Schulhoff et al.)
- Explore **Prompt Engineering Guide** (133+ methods)
- List 10–20 prompting techniques into a mindmap
- Understand taxonomy: zero-shot, few-shot, CoT, ReAct, etc.

---

### 🧠 2. Prompting Core Techniques
- Zero-shot prompting
- Few-shot prompting
- Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
- ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)
- Tree-of-Thought (ToT)
- Self-Ask / Auto-CoT


---

### ⚙️ 3. Inference Parameters & Controls
- Learn temperature (randomness)
- Learn top-p (nucleus sampling)
- Learn top-k (token restriction)
- Explore frequency & presence penalties
- Use stop sequences and max tokens


---

### 🚀 4. LLM Inference Systems
- Learn how inference works (token-by-token)
- Study KV caching, batching, quantization
- Try vLLM / llama.cpp / TGI
- Deploy an LLM API backend (e.g., via FastAPI)

---

### 🛡️ 5. Prompt Optimization & Guardrails
- Learn prompt sensitivity and adversarial prompts
- Study guardrails (delimiters, validation, roles)
- Try Guidance, GuardrailsAI, or TruLens
- Design robust system prompts (role control, self-checks)
